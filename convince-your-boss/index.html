Since you're staring at your screen, you're probably not talking with other designers at the moment; you probably haven't spoken to a designer outside of work in weeks. Let's do something about that.</p></div>

    <div><h2>Email Template:</h2><p>We've made it easy. Here's a template to send to your boss:</p><div class="email"> <div class="hr"><strong>To:</strong> El Jefe [eljefe@mycompany.com]<br /> <strong>Subject:</strong>  UI/UX Conf China 2016 will benefit our design team<br /></div> <div class="article">Dear El Jefe, <br /><br /> <p>Design is our company's heart and soul. We know the importance that design makes in our everyday workflow and our products and how it's an ever-evolving field.  In support of our company's commitment to design, I think we should sponsor our team's attendance at UI/UX Conf China on October 15th-16th in Shanghai (<a href="http://2016.uiuxconf.com/" target="new">http://2016.uiuxconf.com</a>).</p><p>UI/UX Conf is a nonprofit, community-driven conference that focuses on bringing together designers of all disciplines to share in knowledge and community. The conference was born from the UI/UX Designers Meetup in Shanghai and has the strong support of the design community.</p> <p>I believe our company would benefit from our designers' attendance for the following reasons:</p> <ol><li>This conference is a chance to hear from respected designers from all over the world, sharing what they do at their companies</li><li>We'll have the chance to interact with designers from companies like Google, Facebook, frog, Autodesk, Netflix, Mc Donald's, etc  to have success design processes</li><li>This is an opportunity to build a network for recruitment and generating leads</li><li>The price point is awesome - at 600RMB for group deal, it's a steal compared to other conferences in the Asia-Pacific region</li><li>The design team will come back inspired and will learn from the community, bringing back new ideas to the team</li><li>A trip to such an awesome conference will offer us a chance to relax and refresh and return ready to great work</li><li>We should take advantage of this great opportunity to meet designers in the greater Asian community. </li><li>We can take advantage of the early bird discount, or look into the group rates (5 or more at 600 RMB each) offered here. <a href="http://www.bagevent.com/event/156568" target="new">http://www.bagevent.com/event/156568</a> </li></ol><p>Best Regards, <br />Your Dazzling Designer</p></div></div></div>
